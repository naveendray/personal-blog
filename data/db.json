Each service is designed around a specific business function and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.\n\nMicroservices architecture addresses the challenges of monolithic applications, where a single codebase handles various functionalities. With monoliths, making updates or introducing new features can be complex and risky, as changes may inadvertently impact other parts of the application. Microservices, on the other hand, promote modularity and separation of concerns.\n\nIn a microservices architecture, each service has its own codebase, database, and possibly its own programming language.
